DC Metro app high fidelity prototype for the Next Level Competiton

Hello! Thank you for reviewing our application for the Next Level Competition. Since we are in the UX/UI Bootcamp, our project is not code-based. We have created a high-fidelity prototype to test the interactions and design of our app. Below are links we think you will find helpful in reviewing our research and design process.
